# News Database Log Generator 

This is the code to generate a log from the postgress database "news" including the 3 most popular articles, the number of views each author received, and finally any day with more than 1% 404 errors returned.

## Structure

The code is written in python with a single file: **LogGenerator.py**

**LogGenerator.py** had 6 functions and makes 3 queries to the database.
* **dbconnect** creates a database connection and curssor to the news database.  It returns the connection and cursor as a tuple, (conn, cur).
* **dbdisconnect** takes a connection tuple, (conn, cur), and safely closes both the connection and cursor.
* **exec_query** takes in a query string and uses **dbconnect** to execute the query string on the database.  When the query is complete, the results are stored in a local variable and the connection is closed using **dbdisconnect**.  Finally, the results are returned.
* **print_top_articles** queries the database for the top 5 articles by number of views and outputs to console the article names and number of views sorted highest to lowest by number of views.
* **print_top_authors** queries the database for all the authors and outputs the author name and number of views all of the author's articles have received sorted highest to lowest by number of views received.
* **print_error_logs** queries the database for the number of views per day and number of 404 Not Found errors returned.  It then outputs any day with more than a 1% error rate and the corresponding error rate for that day.

## Todo
Change the output to a text file instead of a console output.

## Usage
#### Required software
* Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). This is free software that will run the virtual machine
* Download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). This is an command line utility that makes it easy to manage and access your virtual machines

#### Setting Up Environment
* Create a new folder on your computer named **vagrant** where youâ€™ll store your work for this course, then open that folder within your terminal
* Type `vagrant init` to tell Vagrant what kind of Linux virtual machine you would like to run
* Type `vagrant up` to download and start running the virtual machine
* Unzip **newsdata.sql** from the database folder and save it into the **vagrant** folder you created in step 1

#### Running **LogGenerator.py**
* Within your terminal, type `vagrant ssh` from your folder created in the previous step
* Navigate to the News-Database-Log-Generator folder within your vagrant vm, ex. `cd /vagrant/News-Database-Log-Generator`
* Type `python loggenerator.py` to run the log generator
